-----------
I am doing this project for my object oriented programming course. This project will be graded. Currently I don't have
any idea that what exactly am I gonna do in this project so I can not provide full docs, though I'll keep adding as much
as possible.

As of now the code is like this:
 * This project creates a bank account and provides methods like deposit, withdraw, getBalance and transfer.
 * It automatically generates a sequential new account no for every object of the class starting from 180020131111
 * Currently it has three type of accounts Checking account, Savings account and Fixed deposite account.
